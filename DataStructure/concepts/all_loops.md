# For Full Loops like permutation of neighbours with n neightbours together
We can follow largest_rect_histogram - very good

# Lexicographic for all permutation in order
look lexicographic_order

# DIS JOINT set implementation
look for min_cost_spanning_tree - used simple obj with [parent,rank] array as value
