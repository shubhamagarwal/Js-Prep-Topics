#Depth First Search
- Tree traversal (go to leaf and back for other node)
- Matrix traversal
- Trie for word search
- Here create a stack
- After back tracing choose the one on top (pop)

#Breadth First Search
- Here create a Que
- After back tracing choose the first one in (shift)

#Matching Parenthesis
- Valid bracket in a string
- Or find the bracket that need to be added
- Create a stack and push opening ones in it
- While finding the closing one match with the stack top item
- Also in the end if stack is not empty then indication of some bracket is missing

#Hash Table
- Matrix tracking
- Revisiting grid table can cause you to look at grid index causes resources
- So keep the visited in the hash
- Also in memoization

#Pointer Manipulation
- Pointer like binary search of array (low , high, mid)
- For finding Palindrome in a string
- Traverse all values in array
- Two pointer at each value and moving them out for match finding

#Reversed Lined list
- 3 pointer prev,node,next
- Check if linked list has loop

#Sorting algorithm
- Divide and conquer
- Runtime of sort nlog(n) in avg case

#Recursion
- Recur function with base condition
- return 1 + recurFunc(index+1)

#Custom Data Structure
- trie structure
- Create linked list
- constructing class

#Binary Search
- low high mid
- sorted list of integers
- eliminate half array with mid
- complexity O(log(n))
